Hi, my name is Damir PorobiÄ‡ and I'm a Software Engineer working as a Senior Consultent for [IT Frankfurt GmbH](https://www.it-frankfurt.com/). I'm the developer and Maintainer of [ksnip](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip).

In 2008 I started studying Information Technology at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.fit.ba/) in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, since then I'm passioned about software development. After working for couple of years in the networking industry, I found my way back to software development in 2017 when I started working for [MaibornWolff GmbH](https://www.maibornwolff.de/) and now I'm planning to stay here for couple of years.

I enjoy spending time with my daughter and friends, going on hikes, doing sports, currently I'm mostly playing Badminton and go Jogging as a preparation for a marathon. 

I live and work in Germany in the Frankfurt am Main region.
